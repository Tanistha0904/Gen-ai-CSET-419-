Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

This repository contains Variational Autoencoder (VAE) implementations on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets using deep learning.

The project focuses on:

Encoder–Decoder architecture

Latent space learning

Reparameterization trick

KL Divergence + Reconstruction loss

No output images are generated; the goal is to understand VAE training and logic.
